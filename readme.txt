Data Collection and Preprocessing: Write Java code to collect the dataset and preprocess it. 
This might involve tasks like cleaning missing or inconsistent data, handling categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. 
You can use libraries like Apache Commons CSV for reading CSV files or Jsoup for web scraping.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of your dataset. 
Use Java to calculate descriptive statistics, visualize distributions, and explore relationships between variables. 
You can use libraries like Apache Commons Math for statistical analysis and JFreeChart for data visualization.

Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing features to improve the performance of your model. 
This might involve tasks like one-hot encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, or creating interaction terms.
 Implement these transformations using Java code.

Model Building and Evaluation: Choose a machine learning algorithm (e.g., decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks) and 
implement it using Java. Split your dataset into training and testing sets, train the model on the training set, and evaluate its 
performance on the testing set. Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of your model to improve its performance. Use techniques like grid search or random 
search to search for the optimal hyperparameters. Implement these techniques using Java code.

Model Deployment: Once you're satisfied with the performance of your model, deploy it into production. 
You can create a Java application or web service that takes input data, applies the trained model to make predictions, 
and returns the results to the user.

Documentation and Presentation: Document your project thoroughly, including details about the dataset, data preprocessing steps, 
model architecture, hyperparameters, and evaluation results. Create a presentation or report summarizing your findings and insights.

Continuous Learning: Keep learning and exploring new techniques in data science and machine learning. Experiment with different algorithms, 
datasets, and methodologies to expand your skills and knowledge.
